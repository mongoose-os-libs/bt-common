# Low level Bluetooth support

Currently contains only GATT server implmenetation for ESP32.

## Configuration section

`bt-common` library adds a `bt` configuration section with the following
settings:

```
"bt": {
  "enable": true,             // Enabled by default. Disabled on first reboot with WiFi on
  "dev_name": "",             // Device name. If empty, value equals to device.id
  "adv_enable": true,         // Advertise our Bluetooth services
  "keep_enabled": true,       // Keep enabled after successful boot with WiFi on
  "scan_rsp_data_hex": "",    // Custom scan response data, as hex string (e.g. `48656c6c6f` for `Hello`)
  "allow_pairing": true,      // Allow pairingbonding with other devices
  "max_paired_devices": 10,   // Allow pairing with up to this many devices; -1 - no limit
  "gatts": {
    "min_sec_level": 0,       // Minimum security level for all attributes of all services.
                              // 0 - no auth required, 1 - encryption reqd, 2 - encryption + MITM reqd
    "require_pairing": false  // Require taht device is paired before accessing services
  },
  "gap": {
    "include_name": true,     // Include dev_name in advertisements
    "service_uuid": ""        // Advertise this service uuid
  }
}
```

## Security

Default settings allow for unrestricted access: anyone can pair with a device and access the services.
A better idea is to set `bt.gatts.require_pairing` to true, `bt.allow_pairing` to false and only enable it for a limited time via `mgos_bt_gap_set_pairing_enable` when user performs some action, e.g. presses a button.
Raising `bt.gatts.min_sec_level` to at least 1 is also advisable.
_Note_: At present, level 2 (MITM protection) is not usable as it requires device to have at least output capability during pairing, and there's no API for displaying the pairing code yet.
